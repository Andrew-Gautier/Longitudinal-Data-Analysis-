### Data Analysis performed
Cleaning, coding longitudional responses into a time series format. <br>
Performing interval analysis on the variables related to diseases of cognitive aging. <br> See venv/experiment1.ipynb
Performed several regressions and calculated a confidence interval for our final poster presentation. <br> 


From poster: <br>West Virginia is one of the lowest ranking states in the nation regarding educational quality. As such, the relevance of this research is shown through the impact an education can have on the quality of healthy cognitive aging in the state. With this information policymakers should prioritize funding for initiatives focused on early childhood education, teacher professional development, or curriculum enhancement.

Samplings of longitudinal variables like these can help to make stronger correlations about behaviors which lead to healthier aging. 
Statistical connections like ours can be used as starting points for modeling the onset of cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer's and help contribute to earlier diagnoses as well as a higher quality of prevention and treatment.
